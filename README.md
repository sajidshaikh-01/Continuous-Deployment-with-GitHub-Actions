## üß© Architecture Overview


### ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Flow
1. **CI Pipeline**
   - Triggered when code is pushed to the `main` branch.
   - Builds a Docker image.
   - Pushes the image to Docker Hub (or any registry).
   - Updates the Kubernetes manifests with the new image tag.

2. **CD Pipeline**
   - Triggered automatically after the CI pipeline completes.
   - Connects to **ArgoCD** using CLI and credentials.
   - Syncs the ArgoCD application with the latest manifests.
   - Deploys the new version to **EKS** automatically.
