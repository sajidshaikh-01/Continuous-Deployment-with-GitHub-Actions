#  Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

This repository contains everything I learned about **Continuous Deployment (CD)** using **GitHub Actions**.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- How Continuous Deployment works in a real pipeline
- Setting up GitHub Actions workflows for deployment
- Using environments (development, staging, production)
- Storing and using environment-specific secrets
- Deploying automatically when changes are pushed to `main` branch
- Using Argo CD / Kubernetes for GitOps-based deployment

## 🧩 Workflow Overview

The pipeline runs on every push to the `main` branch:
1. Checks out code  
2. Installs dependencies  
3. Builds the project  
4. Deploys automatically to the production environment  

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add real Argo CD integration (instead of echo)
- Add separate environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Add approval workflow for production
- Integrate Kubernetes and EKS deployment

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions  
- YAML  
- Node.js (example app)  
- Kubernetes / Argo CD (for future deployments)

---

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Modify `cd-pipeline.yml` as per your project setup  
3. Commit and push changes to the `main` branch  
4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the app

> 🧠 **Tip:** Always keep your secrets safe using GitHub Environments → Secrets.
